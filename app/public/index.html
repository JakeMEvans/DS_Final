<br><h2 id ="homeheader"> About Us </h2>
<p> Oconee County Fire Rescue is a mostly volunteer recue organiztion that was established in 1966 because the closest firehouse that was over 50 miles away and getting immediate emergency response was too slow.
  <br>Through the dedication of countless members over the years, we have grown to be one of the most active volunteer corporations in the area, responding to over 6,000 emergency calls per year.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
<h2> Our Mission </h2>
<p> As an organization, we aim to serve the needs of our community by delivering quality emergency life safety services with integrity, commitment, and teamwork. </p>
<br>
<br>



<h2> Who We Are </h2>
<p> OCFR is currently lead by Chief Fire Firefighter Tom Gregory. Tom has served for Oconee Fire Rescure for over 25 years, and has lead the efforts of our organization for the past 8 years.
  <br>Under his leadership, we have gained over 30 volunteers, secured $10,000 in funding and updated almost all of our equipment.
  <br> When Tom is not fighting fires and saving the community he enjoys baking pies, playing Minecraft, and spending time with his family.</p>

<h2> Our Volunteers </h2>
<p> Volunteers are core to the OCRF mission. They are the individuals who work tirelessly to keep our community safe, and many work full-time jobs in addition to helping out whenever they can.
  <br> We would like to spotlight our 2 members of the month Ratna Mandava and Adnan Haiideri for their tireless support, dedication, and selflessness in serving the needs of the Oconee Community.
  <br> If you see them around town make sure to say hello :) </p>
