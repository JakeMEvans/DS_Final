<br><h2 id ="homeheader"> About Us </h2>
<p> Oconee County Fire Rescue is a mostly volunteer recue organiztion that was established in 1966 because the closest firehouse that was over 50 miles away and getting immediate emergency response was too slow.
  <br>Through the dedication of countless members over the years, we have grown to be one of the most active volunteer corporations in the area, responding to over 6,000 emergency calls per year.</p>

<h2> Our Mission </h2>
<p> As an organization, we aim to serve the needs of our community by delivering quality emergency life safety services with integrity, commitment, and teamwork </p>

<h2> Who We Are </h2>
<p> OCFR is currently lead by Chief Fire Firefighter Tom Gregory. Tom has served for Oconee Fire Rescure for over 25 years, and has lead the efforts of our organization for the past 8 years. Under his leadership, we have gained over 30 volunteers, secured $10,000 in funding and updated almost all of our equipment. </p>
